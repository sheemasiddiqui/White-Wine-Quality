# White Wine Quality Dataset

> Multiclass classification in Machine Learning is used in the case of target variables having more than one class for prediction. In this case, many classifiers can be trained on the wine dataset to predict white wine quality. However, for simplicity's sake, this project uses a multiclassification library for python, PyCaret, to predict white wine quality. Because it is a classification project, performance metrics used are 'accuracy,' 'recall,' 'precision,' and 'f1-score' that show which model has the highest accuracy once the models are all trained. Models used for tuning and predicting are Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Logistic Regression. The best performing model was found to be K-Nearest Neighbors having a precision of 0.51, an accuracy rate of 0.4996, approximately close to 50%, and an F1-score of 0.49.
